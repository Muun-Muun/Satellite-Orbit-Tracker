## Usage

---

This app is consists of three parts.

- **TLE data section**
- **Orbit Plotting section**
- **Ground Track section**

### TLE dta section

First, you need to get the current TLE data of the satellite you want to track. See this site.

(If you didn‚Äôs put any datas, it will calculate using defualt values. You can see the default calues from the picture above.)

Pressing the `Upload Data` button, then it display Orbital Elements calculating from your TLE datas.


### Orbit Plotting Section

Pressing the `Plot Orbit` button at left-lower side, you can check the satellite‚Äôs orbit in 2D and 3D Graphics. 

In 3D section, you can find the yellow dot - that‚Äôs your satellite!


### Ground Track section

---

You can set the time range in two ways.

- **Seconds method:** This app shows you the ground-track of your satellite for the seconds you entered.
